<jsptags.com> Pager Tag Library v2.0

The Pager Tag Library is the easy and flexible way to implement paging of
large data sets in JavaServer Pages (JSP). It can emulate all currently
known paging styles with minimal effort. It also includes re-usable index
styles that emulate the search result navigators of popular web sites
such as Google[sm], AltaVistaÂ® and Yahoo!. The Pager Tag Library does most
of the work for you by dynamically organizing your data set into pages and
generating a browsable index with virtually any look desired.

See the file index.html for full details.
